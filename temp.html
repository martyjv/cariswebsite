<div class="title">⋅ Tarot Readings ⋅</div><br><br><br>

Tarot Readings can be a powerful form of gaining intuitive insight. Nothing is written is stone; we always have the ability to change the future with our choices. With insight, we can choose to stay the course or to make positive life-altering decisions. The choice is always yours.
<div class="title">⋅ Past Life Readings ⋅</div><br><br><br>
Past Life Readings can be an insightful way to get in touch with the source of phobias and conflicts in your life and relationships. When you are able to observe the cause of these conflicts, you have the ability to release them at the source. This has proven very helpful in releasing repeat patterns of abuse, fears, struggles, relationship conflicts, and even financial issues.
<div class="title">⋅ Energy & Intuitive Healing ⋅</div><br><br><br>
Energy and Intuitive Healing is a form of healing touch, guidance from Spirit, help from the Angel and Faery Doctors, and psychic surgery. Often physical ailments can manifest from energetic blockages, traumas, or even associations, including, but not limited to, old wounds, confusion, ancestral baggage, or ties to past lives. This can manifest in physical and emotimonal ailments. Intuitively getting at the root of the causes through Energy and Intuitive Healing can have lasting physical healing effects. These sessions include not only healing in-the-moment but also personalized intuitive insights and suggestions on how to make these positive changes permanent.
<div class="title">⋅ Sound Healing ⋅</div><br><br><br>
Sound healing is an ancient method of sending vibration through your mind, body, and spirit. Sound can positively affect the body and may enhance the healing process of emotional, spiritual, and physical trauma. Since everything that is, is vibration, this practice can invoke an impact at the cellular level.
<div class="title">⋅ House Clearings and Blessings ⋅</div><br><br><br>
Do you wonder why you instantly feel a sense of peace and calm when you enter a spiritual space? A house clearing and blessing can make your home feel the same way by clearing imbalances and restoring harmony. Events such as fighting and trauma can leave a negative energetic imprint in the home, disrupting the energy. I suggest always having a home cleared before you move in, as you do not want to take on the energies of the previous renter or owner.
<div class="title">⋅ Spiritual & Intuitive Counseling ⋅</div><br><br><br>
I offer Spiritual/Intuitive Counseling in addition to psychic readings. Spiritual/Intuitive Counseling is similar to Life Coaching; however, it places an emphasis on your spiritual well-being from an intuitive perspective. This style of counseling also provides assistance with your personal growth and related issues such as relationships, finances, career, and health.
<div class="title">⋅ Channeling ⋅</div><br><br><br>
Channeling is a form of bringing information from Spirit. You may hear of channels from a particular soul that has passed over or from an Archangel. I channel  Source, All That Is, The One Mind. I call this source God. Truth is truth by whatever name you call it.
<div class="title">⋅ Spirit Guides ⋅</div><br><br><br>
I like to think of Spirit Guides as our friends who are temporarily without a physical body, and friends from the spirit realm who chose to walk with you while you are in this physical realm. They are as approachable as any good friend and are happy to assist you. Communicating with your Spirit Guides takes some practice, meditation, and the willingness to hear them. I provide exercises which connect you to your own Spirit Guides and can begin your powerful lifelong relationship with them.
<div class="title">⋅ Chakra/Aura Balancing ⋅</div><br><br><br>
Chakra aligning and Aura balancing can benefit your life in many ways. Chakras are the energy centers of the body, and our auras are the ever-changing electromagnetic energy fields that surround our physical bodies. If you are feeling a little "off," you may have an energetic imbalance. An alignment and balancing can restore your energy levels and renew harmony back to your being.
<div class="title">⋅ Guided and Interactive Imagery ⋅</div><br><br><br>
Guided and Interactive Imagery is a visualization technique used to help one's focus and desired outcome of any and all situations. Your subconscious is always trying to bring to you what YOU want most. It is said, "what you think about, you bring about." Using visualization can invoke healing in areas of love, career, finances or whatever it is that you want to manifest.
<div class="title">⋅ Weddings ⋅</div><br><br><br>
Hand-fasting, Hoop Ceremony, Non-Traditional 
As a Reverend, one of my favorite and honored duties is officiating marriage ceremonies. I have the privilege of uniting two loving spirits in ceremony. I offer Pagan, Celtic, 'Handfasting' (where the term "tying the Knot" comes from), Hoop and/or Blanket Ceremony, Native American, non-traditional and even traditional services. You can create your vision of your personal ceremony or I can offer one of the above with a personal touch, of course.
<div class="title">⋅ Purification & Renewal Ceremony ⋅</div><br><br><br>
It is my honor to offer purification and renewal ceremonies for the women nation. Please contact me directly for further information on this sacred ceremony... thank you and blessings.
