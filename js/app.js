            About Cari
        </div>
        I'm Cari......Pheta Uha Mani, welcome. Thank you for your interest in what I do, stopping by and checking out my website.
        I am from and currently live in beautiful San Diego, California with my husband of 25 years, our 3 amazing daughters,
        my cousin, 3 dogs, 1 bird, 1 snake and a Tarantula! It is an honor to introduce myself to you. Blessings. Moran Taing.
        <br><br> Ever since I can remember, I felt there was more than meets the eye, more than I was being told, more than
        just the ordinary mundane and absolutely more than most, could even imagine. Faeries were real, I could see them.
        Angels were all around. My imaginary friends, weren't imaginary. Spirit spoke to me. Dreams I had, came true. I would
        know personal things about people, without knowing them personal ly . 'Make believe' was my reality. Magic was everywhere!
        That was the beginning of a life long relationship and journey with the Fae, Angels and Spirit, as well as, alternative,
        and even controversial traditions, beliefs and teachings.
        <br><br> My first Tarot deck came to me over 30 plus years ago, right around the time I found a book on ESP (extrasensory
        perception) both which I coveted. When I wasn't reading that book or the cards, I was practicing astral projection
        and energy manifestation and manipulation. Also, I was building relationships with my Spirit guides, Faeries, Angels,
        and Spirit. I moved to Los Angeles, where I met others who were interested and regularly practicing similar exercises.
        I sought out teachers, joined circles, became a minister, went to school, read all the books I could get my hands
        on and practiced, practiced, practiced. Knowing in my heart, it was all, to be able to help others. Just like I had
        done in many lifetimes, before. I really just had to trust, and remember.
        <br><br> Around 25 years, ago, I was introduced to the "Red Road", Native American teachings and since have had the
        honor to walk that path simultaneously with my Celtic traditions, which, by the way marry quite beautifully. I have
        always shared my gifts, understandings and teachings with family and friends, and recently have had the calling,
        and time, to "come out", if you will, and go public. So, here I am!
        <br><br> It would be my pleasure and a great honor to work with you, if you so choose. Blessed be, always, in all
        ways.
        <br><br> Aho Mitakuye Oyasin

        <div class="title">⋅ Tarot Readings ⋅</div>
        Tarot Readings can be a powerful form of gaining intuitive insight. Nothing is written is stone; we always have the ability
        to change the future with our choices. With insight, we can choose to stay the course or to make positive life-altering
        decisions. The choice is always yours.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Past Life Readings ⋅</div>
        Past Life Readings can be an insightful way to get in touch with the source of phobias and conflicts in your life and relationships.
        When you are able to observe the cause of these conflicts, you have the ability to release them at the source. This
        has proven very helpful in releasing repeat patterns of abuse, fears, struggles, relationship conflicts, and even
        financial issues.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Energy & Intuitive Healing ⋅</div>
        Energy and Intuitive Healing is a form of healing touch, guidance from Spirit, help from the Angel and Faery Doctors, and
        psychic surgery. Often physical ailments can manifest from energetic blockages, traumas, or even associations, including,
        but not limited to, old wounds, confusion, ancestral baggage, or ties to past lives. This can manifest in physical
        and emotimonal ailments. Intuitively getting at the root of the causes through Energy and Intuitive Healing can have
        lasting physical healing effects. These sessions include not only healing in-the-moment but also personalized intuitive
        insights and suggestions on how to make these positive changes permanent.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Sound Healing ⋅</div>
        Sound healing is an ancient method of sending vibration through your mind, body, and spirit. Sound can positively affect
        the body and may enhance the healing process of emotional, spiritual, and physical trauma. Since everything that
        is, is vibration, this practice can invoke an impact at the cellular level.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ House Clearings and Blessings ⋅</div>
        Do you wonder why you instantly feel a sense of peace and calm when you enter a spiritual space? A house clearing and blessing
        can make your home feel the same way by clearing imbalances and restoring harmony. Events such as fighting and trauma
        can leave a negative energetic imprint in the home, disrupting the energy. I suggest always having a home cleared
        before you move in, as you do not want to take on the energies of the previous renter or owner.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Spiritual & Intuitive Counseling ⋅</div>
        I offer Spiritual/Intuitive Counseling in addition to psychic readings. Spiritual/Intuitive Counseling is similar to Life
        Coaching; however, it places an emphasis on your spiritual well-being from an intuitive perspective. This style of
        counseling also provides assistance with your personal growth and related issues such as relationships, finances,
        career, and health.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Channeling ⋅</div>
        Channeling is a form of bringing information from Spirit. You may hear of channels from a particular soul that has passed
        over or from an Archangel. I channel Source, All That Is, The One Mind. I call this source God. Truth is truth by
        whatever name you call it.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Spirit Guides ⋅</div>
        I like to think of Spirit Guides as our friends who are temporarily without a physical body, and friends from the spirit
        realm who chose to walk with you while you are in this physical realm. They are as approachable as any good friend
        and are happy to assist you. Communicating with your Spirit Guides takes some practice, meditation, and the willingness
        to hear them. I provide exercises which connect you to your own Spirit Guides and can begin your powerful lifelong
        relationship with them.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Chakra/Aura Balancing ⋅</div>
        Chakra aligning and Aura balancing can benefit your life in many ways. Chakras are the energy centers of the body, and our
        auras are the ever-changing electromagnetic energy fields that surround our physical bodies. If you are feeling a
        little "off," you may have an energetic imbalance. An alignment and balancing can restore your energy levels and
        renew harmony back to your being.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Guided and Interactive Imagery ⋅</div>
        Guided and Interactive Imagery is a visualization technique used to help one's focus and desired outcome of any and all situations.
        Your subconscious is always trying to bring to you what YOU want most. It is said, "what you think about, you bring
        about." Using visualization can invoke healing in areas of love, career, finances or whatever it is that you want
        to manifest.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Weddings ⋅</div>
        Hand-fasting, Hoop Ceremony, Non-Traditional As a Reverend, one of my favorite and honored duties is officiating marriage
        ceremonies. I have the privilege of uniting two loving spirits in ceremony. I offer Pagan, Celtic, 'Handfasting'
        (where the term "tying the Knot" comes from), Hoop and/or Blanket Ceremony, Native American, non-traditional and
        even traditional services. You can create your vision of your personal ceremony or I can offer one of the above with
        a personal touch, of course.
        </div>
        <div class="item">
        <div class="title">⋅ Purification & Renewal Ceremony ⋅</div>

        information on this sacred ceremony... thank you and blessings.

    "As a young man continually learning to cooperate harmoniously with my internal and external environments,
    I have found working with Cari "carries the fire" webb to be incredibly beneficial. Over the course of my 27 years, I
    have struggled on and off with various mental, emotional, spiritual, and thus physical imbalances. For me personally,
    this can present as physical pain, anxiety/depression, PTSD, a complete disconnect from physical reality, difficulty
    with personal relationships/vocation, or in worst case scenario all of the above. After having spent years in therapy
    and trying different medications with little/no success, I began working with Cari at the suggestion of a mutual yoga
    friend. In the year plus that we have been working together, I have seen more positive changes happen for me inside and
    out than I did with all of the previous "healthcare" combined. While my improved wellness has also taken much personal
    responsibility, working with Cari proved to be a catalyst towards real healing and an exponentially significant support
    system that I wouldn't have made it this far without. Her skill is exceeded only by her selfless devotion to her work,
    and she is one of the only people I would trust explicitly to help heal my non-physical ailments." 
    <br><br>
    - Colin Somogie, RYT-200, Master's of Traditonal Oriental Medicine Program, Pacific College of Oriental Medicine
    <br><br><br>
    "After 5 years of suffering from an ailment that several MDs could not diagnose or cure, I sought out Reverend
    Cari Webb's healing services. Within one treatment, including the use of sound, crystals, feathers, singing, meditation
    bowls, salt, visualization, and prayer, my ailment disappeared. Cari also provided spiritual insight on the root of what
    was causing the ailment, and what changes I could make in my life, both physical and emotional, to continue to be free
    of it. My session with Cari was about one hour, during which I could feel her powerfully cutting away some unneeded baggage
    and blocks from my energetic body. At the end of the session, which was at noon, and for the rest of the day, I felt
    very light, peaceful, and happy. She truly cleansed my system of negativity which had been weighing on me heavily, and
    which I feel has ancestral origins. I credit Cari for healing myself and my ancestors, as well as the lineage that will
    continue after me. She is honest, talented healer who has a true connection to Spirit and a good heart. Unlike some other
    healers I have met, she is very down-to-earth and I felt immediately comfortable in her presence. I highly recommend
    working with Cari, who truly has a gift to cure and improve conditions you might have given up on healing!" 
    <br><br>
    -Manvi Singh, RYT-500, Founder of Grow and Heal Yoga (growandhealyoga.com) 
    <br><br><br>
    "As with most people I assume, before visiting Ms Cari I already had some knowledge, and/or intuition, about
    my having had past lives. I was told some general things from a girlfriend I once dated. The lady I visit for Medium
    readings told me some very specific things about my parents – but I wasn't ready to put them into place/play just yet,
    so I scoffed them off. Then about two years later, in meditation, I received a Very Very Very Specific message directly
    from my (deceased) mother about our relationship -- connecting this life And a past life; I had absolute belief in what
    I so clearly heard from her but I had no idea how to process this information at that time, so basically it just laid
    dormant within me, until I met Cari. I can tell you that I spent 27 years in various 12 Step groups, and therapies, trying
    to work out the issues that I had with my parents; then I met Cari and she did more for me in one hour than what I was
    able to accomplish in 27 years of 12 Step work. Without any knowledge of my prior messages (trust me I did that on purpose)
    she gave me information that helped me to connect all those prior messages and readings I had in a way that gave me Immediate
    Relief and Understanding of why my parents did what they did. I was able to recover my heart completely intact and move
    forward now with zero pain, regret, or suffering of any sort – 50+ years of pain was gone, just like that it vanished
    almost immediately (well within days of sitting with this new information), it was like she performed open heart surgery
    right there at my dining room table. Ms Cari truly has a gift, and I hope you get to experience it for yourself, and
    I hope that your experience turns out just like mine.
